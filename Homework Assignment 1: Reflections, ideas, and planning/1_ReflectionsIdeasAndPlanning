1. Based on the reports of your fellow classmates during our last class (2021-09-08), please briefly summarize any new ideas for apps to solve people’s problems 
   that you have come up with as a result of listening to other students.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   
   By listening to and asking students for presentations, some of them came up with suggestions to enrich the application. Most of the current applications can only 
   fulfill part of people's requirements, such as music software can only listen to songs but not sing, ticket purchase software is not comprehensive, and need to 
   open multiple programs and so on. Of course, for the other part of the current software, their interface is too complex, too many ads, so that people have trouble
   to use them. Therefore, simplifying the application interface and improving the program function has become the choice of most people.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. Several people mentioned the “conflict” between the desire to have a free app, and developers’ desire (and need) to get compensated. Can you suggest any ways 
   by which developers can reap their creativity’s and efforts’ rewards without alienating their “customer base” by inundating with ads and/or charging them.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Today, many programs have to be purchased in advance to use them or have to pay to unlock all the functions, which makes people feel uncomfortable. In fact, I 
   think developers can create free apps that allow people to use all the features. For revenue, developers can choose to communicate and advertise with products 
   associated with the app or with in-app brands, much like YouTube. Don't run ads that aren't relevant to the app, and don't run them for too long. This will 
   keep users interested and not annoying, and it will be a win-win for both the developer and the brand partner.

3. Please point to any app/software/website that offers in your opinion an excellent UI/UX. Briefly explain in what ways you find its UI/UX to be so good.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   I think Google Maps has a better UI. First enter this application, the interface is very simple, map information directly displayed on the main interface, 
   convenient for users to check their location in the first time. On the menu bar below the app, there are different options that the user can choose according to 
   the purpose. For example, explore nearby fun places, get traffic conditions on nearby roads for the best travel information, see where you've been, and take 
   advantage of the powerful Google cloud backup feature. Of course, the most important thing is navigation information. Users can customize the navigation path, 
   and see what looks like near the destination, and the information broadcast is very timely, so that users can easily and quickly reach the destination.

4. Have last class’s discussions and/or items #1-3 gotten you closer toward a mobile app you would like to pursue as a project for this course? Please discuss 
   briefly.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Through the above discussion, I am more determined to be a mobile application programmer of this course. According to the existing program, I want to make a 
   simple interface and rich functions of the program, so as to meet the requirements of most users. If necessary, I'd like to port web-based apps to mobile phones 
   or brand-new mobile apps to make people's lives more convenient.

Our project is called Gomoku Game and it is going to solve the problem of people's mental health. 
Its goal is to provide people with more ways to entertain themselves and to enhance the friendship 
and communication between people. The reason why I choose to do the Gomoku Game from other types of 
entertainment software is that my team member and I both come from China, and at the same time 
the Gomoku game is also originated from China. Making this app is about to develop and 
expand our traditional culture and let people like it. Compared with other entertainment software, 
the Gomoku Game is easy to learn and play, it do not have so many rules to remember. 
Also, the Gomoku Game can enhance people's thinking ability and improve intelligence.
